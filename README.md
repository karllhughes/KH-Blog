# Karl L. Hughes' Personal Blog

This is my personal blog. It's a PHP/Wordpress application using the 
[Bedrock Wordpress boilerplate](https://github.com/roots/bedrock) to modernize Wordpress
and allow me to include my theme and plugins via composer. 

## Features

- Links to my social media accounts
- An "About Me" page
