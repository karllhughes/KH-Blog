# Karl L. Hughes' Personal Blog

Hey guys, this is my personal blog. It's a slightly customized instance of Wordpress
based on [Matt Hoofman's Heroku Wordpress project](https://github.com/mhoofman/wordpress-heroku). 
The biggest difference with my version is that I don't use a local postgres DB.

## Features
This site can be found at [karllhughes.com](http://www.karllhughes.com), and includes:

- Links to my social media accounts
- An "About Me" page
- Contact information
- Blog posts

## Technical Details
- Wordpress powered backend using a MySql database
- Hosted on Heroku (for now)

## Features I'm Considering Adding
- Subscribe...but who would want to be on my email list?
- Add a [Twitter comments stream](https://dev.twitter.com/web/embedded-timelines/search#url)
- Project archive
- Links to articles written for other sites
